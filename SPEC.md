# Moonshot Landing Page Specification

*Created: Feb 3, 2026 — Pulse I001*
*Status: DRAFT — Ready for review*

---

## Purpose

A landing page for Moonshot that:
1. **Establishes credibility** when developers Google "ofek.moonshot@gmail.com"
2. **Converts interested developers** who receive outreach emails
3. **Signals professionalism** to differentiate from tire-kickers

---

## Target Audience

**Indie app developers** who:
- Have built something they're proud of
- Are time-constrained (day job or burned out)
- Want help monetizing/scaling without selling their soul
- Skeptical of "acquisition" cold emails

---

## Key Messages

### Primary Value Prop
**"Your app. Our resources. Shared success."**

Moonshot partners with indie developers to:
- Handle monetization, marketing, and scale
- Preserve the app's identity and user trust
- Let developers focus on what they love (or move on gracefully)

### Why Moonshot?
1. **Built by a builder** — Ofek is an Android engineer at Instagram/Meta, not a private equity shark
2. **Partnership over acquisition** — Revenue share, not hostile takeover
3. **Transparent process** — No tricks, no pressure, no lowball offers

---

## Page Structure (2026 Trends Applied)

### 1. Hero Section (Story-Driven)
```
Headline: "Your app deserves more than a slow death in the Play Store"
Subheadline: "We help indie developers monetize, scale, or find a great exit — on your terms."
CTA: "Let's Talk" → Simple contact form
Visual: Animated graph showing app growth trajectory
```

### 2. The Problem (Empathy First)
```
"You built something amazing. But...
- You're burned out from side-project grind
- Monetization feels like selling out
- You don't have time for marketing and growth
- Watching your app stagnate hurts"

We get it. We're developers too.
```

### 3. What We Offer
```
Three paths:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PARTNERSHIP          ACQUISITION       GROWTH HELP │
│ Revenue share        Fair exit         Advisory    │
│ We handle biz        You move on       You stay    │
│ You stay involved    Dignified end     We consult  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. About / Credibility
```

between their passion and their sanity."

```

### 5. How It Works
```
1. We reach out (or you do)
2. 30-min call to understand your situation
3. Custom proposal within a week
4. Partnership or acquisition, your choice
5. Ongoing support, transparent terms
```

### 6. FAQ
```
Q: Are you going to ruin my app with ads?
A: No. We respect what you built. Monetization = premium features, not ad spam.

Q: What's in it for you?
A: Revenue share on partnerships. For acquisitions, we grow apps we believe in.

Q: What happens to my users?
A: They stay. We don't do acqui-hires. The app continues, better supported.

Q: Do I have to sell?
A: No. Partnership means you stay involved. Acquisition is optional.
